Finite Automata and Formal Grammars

	Description
This project focuses on validating and constructing different types of formal language models:

*DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)
*NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)
*CFG (Context-Free Grammar)
*PDA (Pushdown Automaton)
The implementation provides methods to define, test, and convert between these models.

	Features
*DFA & NFA Construction – Define states, transitions, and acceptance conditions.
*NFA to DFA Conversion – Implements subset construction algorithm.
*CFG Validation – Verify if a given string belongs to a context-free language.
*PDA Simulation – Test input strings against pushdown automata.
*Graphical Representation – (Optional) Visualize automata structures.

	Technologies Used
*Python 3
*Graphviz (for visualization, if applicable)
