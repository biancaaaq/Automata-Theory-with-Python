# Finite Automata and Formal Grammars

 This repository provides tools for constructing, validating, and converting between different formal language models used in automata theory and computational linguistics.

---

## 📌 About the Project
This project focuses on **finite automata and formal grammars**, offering a set of tools for working with the following models:

🔹 **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)** – A machine that processes input strings with a single deterministic path.

🔹 **NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)** – A more flexible automaton where multiple transitions are possible.

🔹 **CFG (Context-Free Grammar)** – A set of recursive rules defining a context-free language.

🔹 **PDA (Pushdown Automaton)** – An automaton equipped with a stack, capable of recognizing context-free languages.

The implementation allows defining, testing, and converting between these models, making it a valuable tool for studying formal languages and automata.

## ✨ Features
✅ **DFA & NFA Construction** – Define states, transitions, and acceptance conditions for automata.

✅ **NFA to DFA Conversion** – Implements the **subset construction algorithm** for deterministic conversion.

✅ **CFG Validation** – Check if a given string belongs to a context-free language using parsing techniques.

✅ **PDA Simulation** – Test input strings against **pushdown automata**, analyzing stack operations.

✅ **Graphical Representation** *(Optional)* – Visualize automata structures using graph-based representations.
